But you can also ruin the lives of the crewmates with sabotages specific to this map.\n\n - Seismic stabilisers: crewmates must pay attention to this warning despite its long delay. If no one takes care of it, they will be defeated. As the two stabilisers are not in the same place, this sabotage also separates the survivors into two groups.\n - Doors: On this map, doors can be opened manually, but remain closed for the duration if no one opens them.

As you have to pass through the Y, those who cannot be traced must have used winds.\n - The administration table: always on the job.",

Ideal to separate the players."
