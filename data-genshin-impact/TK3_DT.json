More so than any other mobile game we've played, Genshin Impact is overflowing with content. There's tons of depth to its systems/combat, a vast amount of things players can do at any one point, and it even has the developers asking fans for their input,",

It can be a lot at first, so here are some tips we've discovered 30+ Adventure Ranks into the game that we wish we knew way back at the start. \n \n Updated on September 3rd, 2021, by Scott Vengel: Since the release of Inazuma back in update 2.0, and the more recent release of Watatsumi and Seirai island in update 2.1, Genshin Impact has expanded considerably. As such, there are plenty of difficulties that players will face as they travel through new and old regions of the game. From tricky slopes and edges to new challenging bosses, the game continues to challenge new players looking to learn the ropes. As such, this list will be expanded to add a few additional tips so that players can have an easier time in both exploring and combat."
